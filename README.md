# Python - Variable Annotations ‚ù§

## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School's web back-end training program. It focuses on the use of type annotations in Python 3.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand type annotations in Python 3
- Know how to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Understand Duck typing
- Know how to validate your code with mypy

## Tasks

The project includes several tasks, each focusing on a different aspect of type annotations in Python. Tasks include annotating functions to specify the types of their arguments and return values, annotating variables with specific types, and using complex types such as lists, tuples, and functions.
